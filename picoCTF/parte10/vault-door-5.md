### vault-door-5
## Objetivo
In the last challenge, you mastered octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, but this vault door uses a different change of base as well as URL encoding! The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor5.java](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/d31ce4356bdfd15d33a9af7e35ab4d0a/VaultDoor5.java)
## Hints
1. You may find an encoder/decoder tool helpful, such as https://encoding.tools/
2. Read the wikipedia articles on URL encoding and base 64 encoding to understand how they work and what the results look like.
